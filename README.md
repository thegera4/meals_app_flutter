# meals_app

This is an app made with flutter / dart that allows you to take a look at different meals, grouped by category, and all the details about the recipe.

The app includes navigation via bottom tabs as well as a side drawer that can be opened with the hamburguer icon or swiping from the left part of the screen.

The app also includes a filters page/view, where you can set some filters by taping on the save button in the top bar, in order to see only those types of meals in the categories screen.

Finally, you can also save your favorite meals by taping in the yellow star button.

The most important concepts that I practiced with this app are:
- Passing data between different screens,
- Navigation between different screens with bottom tabs, drawer and taps on a card (for each item).
- Several dart list methods for the general logic
- Styles
